        <p class="article-text">The International Space Station is a modular space station in low Earth orbit. It
         flies 400 km high at speeds that defy gravity â€“ literally. At 28,800 km/h it only takes 92 minutes for the
            weightless laboratory to make a complete circuit of Earth. Astronauts working and living on the Station
            experience 16 sunrises and sunsets each day.
